                The Museum of Ontario Archaeology is home to an amazing collection of artifacts and provides a venue for
                school programming, academic research, and cultural events. The preservation of Lawson Site is of great
                importance and gives us a unique opportunity to build greater understanding, appreciation, and respect
                for
                First Nations peoples, their history, and their culture.The Museum of Ontario Archaeology is a unique
                Canadian museum devoted to the study, display, and interpretation of the human occupation of
                Southwestern
                Ontario over the past 13,000 years. The Museum is located beside the Lawson Site, which was occupied in
                the
                16th century A.D.
